# Electrophysiology Processing GUI 

A work in progress GUI that takes in .pkl files converted from .pxp files generated by NeuroMatic, an Igor Pro software package for acquisition, analysis and simulation of electrophysiological data. 

Processed file example used for demonstration: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1awD2AxCFN5Aaq8gRkeWKjFNtOzYFbqve/view?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1awD2AxCFN5Aaq8gRkeWKjFNtOzYFbqve/view?usp=sharing) 

Example on how to run Code from terminal to run the GUI:

```
python Run_GUI.py --config_file_path /Users/samgritz/Desktop/Ephys-Processing-GUI-main/Default_Metadata_new_stims_dev_080724.yaml --interactive --debug

```

## Example usage

### Analyzing Action Potential Properties 
GUI includes the ability to measure various properties of neuron action potentials (AP) including: **AP threshold**, **AP firing rate**, **AP inter-spike-interval**, **AP halfwidth**, **AP size**, **After-Hyperpolarization size**, **After-Hyperpolarization halfwidth** 

- **AP Threshold:** the voltage (mV) at which the action potential is triggered. Measure as the Max value of the first derivative before the peak of the action potential.
