# Electrophysiology Processing GUI 

A work in progress GUI that takes in .pkl files converted from .pxp files generated by NeuroMatic, an Igor Pro software package for acquisition, analysis and simulation of electrophysiological data. 

Processed file example used for demonstration: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1awD2AxCFN5Aaq8gRkeWKjFNtOzYFbqve/view?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1awD2AxCFN5Aaq8gRkeWKjFNtOzYFbqve/view?usp=sharing) 

Example on how to run Code from terminal to run the GUI:

```
python Run_GUI.py --config_file_path /Users/samgritz/Desktop/Ephys-Processing-GUI-main/Default_Metadata_new_stims_dev_080724.yaml --interactive --debug

```

## Example usage

### Analyzing Action Potential Properties 
GUI includes the ability to measure various properties of neuron action potentials (AP) including: **AP threshold**, **AP firing rate**, **AP inter-spike-interval**, **AP halfwidth**, **AP size**, **After-Hyperpolarization size**, **After-Hyperpolarization halfwidth**, and **Rheobase**. 

- **AP Threshold:** The voltage (mV) at which the action potential is triggered. Measured as the max value of the first derivative before the peak of the action potential.
- **AP Firing Rate:** The firing rate or frequency is the number of action potentials per second. This is one of the key electrophysiological features of neurons.
- **AP inter-spike-interval (ISI):** A measure of the time between subsequent action potentials. This is typically used to measure _frequency adaptation_, which is a ratio between early ISI (e.g. the time between the first two action potentials) and late ISI (e.g. the last two action potentials) in the same trace.
